2. Title: Blockchain Witness.  
3. Synopsis: Tamper-resistant sufficient evidence of performed operations, involving secure randomized multi-route comm channel to the blockchain, in which packets are tagged with unique mission metadata, including GUID generators, two-way encryption keys, blockchain hashes, consensus-encoded unique environmental events, security hardware attributes.  

## Comm channels

1. WiFi.  
2. SDR.  
3. Ham radio.  
4. Satellite.  
5. Mobile phone.  
6. Telemetry.  

## Autonomous missions

1. Relief delivery.      (Deliver relief with strong proof.)  
2. Public-event witness. (Camera capture and real-time broadcast with strong proof.)  
3. Inclement weather.    (Maintain strong proof despite intermittent access to blockchain.)
